Undefined: in main.h add:

const int MOTIONBUTTON_UP 		= 0x0;
const int MOTIONBUTTON_DOWN 		= 0x1;
const int MOTIONBUTTON_LEFT 		= 0x2;
const int MOTIONBUTTON_RIGHT 		= 0x3;
extern bool motionButtonDown[4];
Undefined says:
Undefined: put at the top of gameinit.cpp
bool motionButtonDown[4] = {false, false, false, false};
Undefined says:
Undefined: in main.cpp, replace the line that checks for SDLK_ESCAPE that I added with everything here

Undefined: its alot of code..but its simple as can be.
we just set or unset the booleans for our motion buttons when the keys are up or down
Undefined: it checks for WSAD and the arrow keys to represent the input. allows for greater usability  
Undefined: then, in your game code, you just do 

if (motionButtonDown[MOTIONBUTTON_LEFT]){/* mover player left */}
Undefined: simple
