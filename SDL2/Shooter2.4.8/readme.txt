This was the space shooter I was working on with 1942 images. I stopped working on it but would like to continue one day. Right now 
I opted for main ship health rather than instant ship death. I don't have it exploding when your health 
reaches zero but that's easy enough to add.

Enjoy!

Compiled on Linux 

Required SDL 1.2
Scons be installed

The SCcontruct is there all you need to do is run scons. I compiled this on Linux.
If you want to get a hold of me you can @ rcmancanada@gmail.com
 
sudo apt install scons

Make should work as well


Compiile for MAC

Download homebrew to your Mac.

Go to: https://brew.sh.     and it gives you instructions on how to do that.

Once that is installed type: brew install git

Once that is complete run this command: git clone https://github.com/rcman/mybrew/

This will clone this to your machine

perform the command chmod +x on brew_install.sh

then just run it by typing ./brew_install  and press ENTER

Let it install everything it needs.  If you already git cloned the shooter to your machine than all you need to run is: scons within the shooter directory/

Have fun

Thanks
