        Gamdemo demonstrates the performance of the Gport game port
        library and BIOS game port support (INT 15/84). It shows the
        current joystick position(s) and button status. In addition,
        some of the function keys access some of the calibration and
        centering features. The function keys are defined as follows:



        F1 - Calibrate the X axis on joystick A.
        F3 - Calibrate the X axis on joystick B.

             To calibrate the X axis on a joystick,  hold the joystick
             all the way to the right and press F1 (for joystick A) or
             F3 (for joystick B). Then hold the joystick all the way to
             the left and press F1/F3. Gport will now use this new
             information to more accurately calibrate the joystick's X
             axis.


        F2 - Calibrate the Y axis on joystick A.
        F4 - Calibrate the Y axis on joystick B.

             To calibrate the Y axis on a joystick,  hold the joystick
             all the way up and press F2 (for joystick A) or F4. (for
             joystick B)Then hold the joystick all the way down and press
             F2/F4. Gport will now use this new information to more
             accurately  calibrate the joystick's Y axis.


        F5 - Toggle centering mode.

             There are two centering modes offered in Gport. The
             first, and the default, is REAL mode. In real mode Gport
             will consider the location of where the joystick comes
             to rest to be center. The second centering mode is MEAN
             mode. In MEAN mode Gport considers the mean between the
             two extremes of the joystick axes, acquired from the
             calibration (F1 to F4), to be center. Note that until the
             joystick is  calibrated, there is little difference between
             the two modes.


        F6 - Gport/BIOS toggle

             This option allows you to compare the Gport functions to
             BIOS joystick support.  Notice in particular that Gport
             is much faster resulting in smoother transitions and
             higher resolution.  NOTE: PC, PCjr and PC XT with BIOS
             dated before 8 Nov 82 do not have BIOS joystick support.

        F7 - Reinitialize

             This option as far as Gport is concerned is essentially
             the same as terminating the program and restarting it.
             All calibration data is deleted and the joystick is
             reinitialized. You may want to exercise this option if,
             for instance, the joystick was not at rest when the
             program was initially invoked or if you had only one
             joystick and wanted to switch from joystick A to B.



        The source code for Gamdemo is provided for your inspection.
        It is, however, compiled with function that are exclusive to
        the Borland/Turbo C graphics library. If you have a similar
        graphics library, you could replace the Borland graphics
        library functions. The functions are as follows:


            bar               - draws a filled bar
            circle            - draws circle
            cleardevice       - clears the graphics screen
            closegraph        - closes the graphics mode
            detectgraph       - detects the graphics driver
            fillellipse       - draws and fills an ellipse
            getcolor          - gets the current drawing color
            getfillsettings   - gets the current fill settings
            getimage          - gets a stored image
            getmaxx           - gets the max number of pixels in x
            getmaxy           - gets the max number of pixels in x
            imagesize         - determines an image's storage size
            initgraph         - initializes graphics mode
            line              - draws a line
            linerel           - draws a relative line
            moveto            - move to
            outtextxy         - puts text at x,y
            putimage          - puts an image into storage
            registerbgidriver - registers a linked graphics driver
            registerbgifont   - registers a linked font
            setbkcolor        - sets the background color
            setcolor          - sets the drawing color
            setfillstyle      - sets the fill style
            settextstyle      - sets the text style
            textheight        - determines the hight of a text string
            textwidth         - determines the width of a text string
